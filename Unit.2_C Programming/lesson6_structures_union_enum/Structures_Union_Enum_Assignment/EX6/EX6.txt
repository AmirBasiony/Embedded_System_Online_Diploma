Output:
size of union=32
size of structure=40


Explaination:
>>>>Storing  size of union 
    is equal to the biggest size of datatype of it's members.
    (char name[32])>> the biggest size consist of 32 Bytes. 
>>>>Storing  size of structure 
     is equal to the sumintion of size of the datatypes of all members.
     (char name[32])+(float salary)+ (int worker_no) = 32+4+4 = 40 Bytes.
